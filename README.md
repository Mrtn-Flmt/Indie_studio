Hello to you, dear player.
This description is here to introduce you to our game, our team and how it works.

"Bompotter" is a bomberman game based on the theme of harry potter.
Created by our team:
- Project Manager/Developer : Thibault Campagne
- Developer: Alex Lehmann
- Developer: Thomas Gireaudot
- Developer: Enguerrand Van-de-velde
- Developer: Martin Flament

Unfortunately, the rendering of this project did not meet our expectations, but it is still playable. The goal of the game is of course to win against the opponents, by exploding them with the bombs you have.

How to play?
Joystick : Does not work 
Keyboard : Player 1 : Z - Q - S - D - R
           Player 2: UP - DOWN - RIGHT - LEFT - CTRL
           Player 3: G - B - V - N - SPACE
           Player 4: O - K - L - M - ^

The game has no active bonuses such as power up, speed up, fire up, wall pass

I thank you for your time, and most of all have FUN
